# Salus Home Assistant Integration

This custom integration provides a dummy Salus thermostat for Home Assistant. It exposes:

- Room temperature sensor (returns a constant value of 23°C)
- Target temperature sensor
- Thermostat entity with `heat` and `off` modes

The integration does not communicate with any real devices and is intended as a starting point for further development.

2. Install the **Salus** integration from HACS.
